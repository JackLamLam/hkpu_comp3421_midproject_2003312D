    <h1>Self-Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am Lam Shu Yu, born in 1998, and I am currently studying in the third year of the Financial Technology of Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

    Since I was 10, I have always liked studying computers . For example, when I was young, my family would lock the computer, and I would use different methods to crack the password. Many times I can use the computer smoothly.  I chose related subjects in the my high school.  In the process of learning, I have also been looking for other courses on the Internet, reading and learning courses related to computers and networks, such as artificial intelligence technology and so on.

    In addition, I also work for Prudential Insurance Company. The main job is to communicate with customers, follow up, receive customers and process insurance policies, and help customers improve their financial management concepts, so that customers can have a more secure life.

    I think my advantages are as follows: First, strong communication skills, able to deal with customers smoothly.</p>
